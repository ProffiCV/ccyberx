Public Internet Usage (CyberCaffe)

This system was created in 2002-2005 (and maintained until 2012 - Bug corrections, new features...),
it was designed for Windows XP (tested and working perfectly)

The system helped people manage Internet Public Usage (Controlling computer time usage, Megabytes downloaded etc).


Composed with 3 components
Client (cCyberX) - Client Control
cCard-X (Card generator and manager)
sServer-X (Server - Remote control for clients and usage details)


Please, am doing this share, just to help students get in touch with some advanced features for windows, Regedit, Network,
AM NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY WRONG USAGE (DO NOT RUN THE SYSTEM WITHOUT UNDERSTAND HOW IT WORKS)
